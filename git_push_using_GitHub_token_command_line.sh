# Note:
# Personal Access Tokens (PAT) can only be used for HTTPS git operations. Switch your repository to HTTPS if it is using SSH.

# Once you have a token, you can use it instead of your password when performing git push operations over HTTPS as below:


git push https://<GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>@github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY_NAME>.git


# Note: Remember to replace <GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN>, <GITHUB_USERNAME>, <REPOSITORY_NAME> with your token, username and repository.
