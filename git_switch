# As before, start by fetching the latest remote changes:
git fetch origin

#This will fetch all of the remote branches for you. You can see the branches available for checkout with:
git branch -v -a

#With the remote branches in hand, you now need to check out the branch you are interested in with -c to create a new local branch:
git switch -c test origin/test
